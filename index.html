            <img src="images/Me.jpg" alt="Matthew Conacher - Software Engineer" style="float:left" class="left-img">

            <p>A passionate engineer, with a natural curiosity and an eye for detail, obsessed with making things better.</p>

            <p>15 years commercial experience working in multi-disciplinary Engineering teams to design and release world-leading products.</p>

            <p>Recently qualified as a Software Engineer - I have always loved computers, since my father bought home a ZX Spectrum, which enthralled me and the bug didn't let go.</p>

            <p>As an engineer coding is something I reach to when I need to do something faster/more efficiently, or it is simply impossible without code. I have successfully implemented many internal systems and procedures using scripts over the years with
                anything from Visual Basic to X86 Assembly.</p>

            <p><b>Now it's time to take it to the next level.</b></p>

            <h3><strong>Controlled Torque Wrench Tester, Front and Backend (Gedore Torque)</strong></h3>

            Designed and built an automated torque wrench tester that interfaced to the test device using serial commands created with Python. Results of the test logged to a MySQL database using programmatically generated SQL. PLC device was programmed to control
            stepper motors to perform required movements safely and repeatably.

            <h3><strong>Packaging Database (Procter and Gamble)</strong></h3>

            Implemented a global packaging database, to enable eco savings and strategic packaging planning. Access database with Visual Basic GUI, data also automatically pulled from SAP stock control database using SQL. Queries written in SQL. VBScript used for
            data entry of vast amounts of global supplier specification and cost data. Allowed searching for engineering attributes of worldwide packaging.

            <h3><strong>Drawings Browser (Scott Wilson Railways) - Industrial Placement Project</strong></h3>

            Implemented a GUI for searching and viewing engineering drawings, implemented in Visual Basic with a backend database built using Access. Queries built on the fly using SQL based on user input which then returns the correct PDF/PNG drawing on the system
            for the engineer to inspect. 60000+ drawings indexed on the system, retrieval from the network within seconds based on metadata stored with the scanned prints. Replaced paper system completely, fully future proofed company drawings system.

            <h3><strong>Education Finance - London Borough of Croydon</strong></h3>

            Implementing VBA macros for Excel to produce financial data for schools. Ad-hoc preparation of presentation data for local authority accountants that visit schools to give finance guidance on a regular basis. Year end accounts were also automated using
            macros.
